# Bookkeeper

Now and then I have LAN-parties with my friends. Everyone pays for different stuff, but we like to keep it fair.
With Bookkeeper you can easily keep track of who pays how much to get what for whom, with output as an html page so everyone can view the current state of affairs.

At the moment it's not efficient at all, so that's something I'll try to improve, but it should be good enough for most cases.
